BoltzPY
=======

	BoltzPy is a deterministic solver 
	for the Boltzmann equation for gas mixtures.
	It is based on Discrete Velocity Models (DVM) 
	and verifies theoretical results of the authors PhD thesis.
	All figures and results in the thesis 
	were generated by scripts in the bin folder.



Basic Structure of the Code:
----------------------------
    
    Any simulation is set up by creating
    a :py:class:`boltzpy.Simulation` instance.
    This instance can call its
    :py:meth:`~boltzpy.Simulation.compute` method
    to start the simulation and has methods to animate the results.
